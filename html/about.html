                Growing up in a developing city in Vietnam, technology and the internet opened my eyes.
                When I attended high school, I became fascinated by problem solving and physics thanks to The Big Bang Theory episodes.
                Later, I moved to the US for undergraduate study and fell in love with numbers and coding.
                I interned at CERN as a data analyst who had little background in programming,
                which motivated me to explore deeper and learn more about statistics and analysis.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Passionate about data analysis, I pursued a master's in Statistics. 
                One of my most significant achievements is creating multiple Python Apps that automate data entry, 
                ensuring accuracy and efficiency for daily use by my team.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Upon leaving academia, I embraced the "tech-first" and "automated everything" mindset.
                Out of curiosity, I have conducted several projects involving machine learning and multivariate statistics.
                I am open to opportunities as a data analyst/scientist in a dynamic organization, 
                where I can leverage my skills to drive success for the company.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                🔬👨‍🔬 Evolving into a data wizard, I specialize in data governance, automation, and cutting-edge techniques
                like machine learning and AI training. Proficient in Python, R, MySQL, Excel, and data visualization, 
                I make data-driven decisions in business.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                In my current role as a Team Lead at KBRA, I optimize processes through data governance and automation. 
                My commitment is to deliver tangible results with notable business value through the power of data analysis 
                and strategic decision-making.
